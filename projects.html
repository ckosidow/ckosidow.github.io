                    Fastenal Product Search UI

                        My team at Fastenal worked on a number of search APIs for the company. One prominent
                        API was our product API, but our team had no official front-end to showcase its features
                        and functionality. So I made an SPA using Vue JS, Vue Router, Spring Boot and Bulma CSS to
                        show how quick and accurate our search engine could be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had some interesting learning lessons with this project. Handling state and navigation
                        was initially a problem as I tried to do this manually using a big javascript object. I
                        JSON stringified it and encoded it in the URL to handle page reloads and URL sharing. This
                        quickly became a problem as the URLs were too large and I feared I was reinventing the
                        wheel, making the app too confusing to maintain. This led to Vue Router and I redesigned
                        the app to utilize routes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoyed working on this project, fiddling with UI elements and learning Vue. With
                        more time and resources one future change would be storing shareable links in a database
                        rather than passing parameters around during navigation. The URLs ended up being
                        large and unsightly; keeping them simple with a shareable link option could contribute
                        nicely to the overall app experience.

                        My team at Fastenal had an internal tool we used for certain aspects of product management, but
                        the
                        creators of the tool were no longer accessible and the tool had been built in a language my team
                        wasn't
                        familiar with (C#). I was tasked with migrating this tool to Java; the means of doing so were
                        left up
                        to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to make a Spring Boot application. This allowed me to easily configure LDAP,
                        role-based
                        authentication. Migrating methods from C# to Java wasn't too lofty a task as I came to find the
                        languages quite similar. With the exception of a few methods this migration happened rather
                        quickly.

                        The front-end was written in AngularJS, which nobody on my team was familiar with. My team being
                        a
                        back-end heavy team we unfortunately didn't have any experience with any other front-end
                        framework or
                        tool other than jQuery. So I decided to stick with AngularJS and modify as needed. A transition
                        to
                        another framework would have likely been more costly than worth as AngularJS serviced the needs
                        of the
                        site.

                        I wanted to play with Spotify's APIs so I built a website using Node JS, Express, AWS,
                        among others, which would return metrics for playlists and individual songs such as
                        "danceability", tempo and popularity. I also wanted a tool I could use to enhance my playlist to
                        be
                        more dance-worthy, but it turned out simple metrics couldn't pull a good playlist from nothing.

                        There weren't too many challenges with this project, but the project itself was rather
                        small. Spotify made it easy to authenticate users with OAuth2 and the documentation for their
                        APIs was quite extensive. This was my first project deploying a site through AWS so I had to
                        familiarize myself with the CI/CD pipeline, S3 buckets and deployment configurations.
                        I didn't fully understand rate limiting through their free tier so I pulled the site down to
                        prevent unwanted costs.

                        During my junior year of college I joined the fledgling Computer Science club. In need of a
                        project
                        we reached out to the club in charge of hosting university events. They wanted both an iOS and
                        Android app that would display their upcoming events and allow them to host giveaways during
                        events. Another club member took up the iOS app so I built the Android app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a challenging task as I had never built an Android app before. I spent the majority of
                        my
                        winter break learning app development, Gradle, and Facebook's graph API. We also used a
                        hosted database solution which has since moved to a paid model, breaking our app as
                        interest in the project was lost and nobody want to pay to keep it up and running.
